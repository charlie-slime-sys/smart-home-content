                <li>The camera at the front door is equipped with advanced features for enhanced security. It integrates
                    with the
                    systemâ€™s cloud-based memory storage for real-time data access and management. The camera includes
                    self-protection mechanisms, such as password security to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally,
                    it
                    utilizes
                    sound recognition to identify and differentiate between pets and potential intruders, contributing
                    to a
                    comprehensive security solution.</li>

            <p><strong>Robotic Rodents</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cleaning robotic mice and rats are designed to handle household dirt and dust efficiently. The mice
                    navigate
                    various surfaces to perform regular cleaning tasks, ensuring a dust-free environment. Meanwhile, the
                    copper
                    scrap rats are tasked with collecting and transporting larger trash items to the incinerator.
                    Together,
                    these
                    robots significantly reduce manual cleaning efforts and maintain a cleaner living space.</li>

            <h3>Safety</h3>
            <p><strong>Fire Safety Robots</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The safety robots are integral to a high-tech safety system designed to address various hazards.
                    They
                    include
                    automated units that respond to emergencies and work in tandem with fire alarms that offer both
                    visual
                    and
                    auditory alerts. For water-related issues, ceiling walls and water rats manage leaks, while the
                    robots
                    use
                    green
                    chemical responses and venomous snakes deliver a chemical deterrent to ensure comprehensive
                    protection.
                    This
                    system combines automated and chemical methods to provide thorough safety coverage.</li>
